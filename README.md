Canadian Household Finance Study using Pandas and Matplotlib
----------

Through the analysis of data provided by Statistics Canada, we can gain insights into the spending habits of Canadian households over the past decade, from 2012 to 2022. This initial analysis was exploratory in nature, aiming to provide insight into Canadian spending. Simply put: “What are Canadians spending their money on?”. Looking at this data can provide Canadians with useful insights into how they spend their money and how their spending habits compare to those of other households in Canada. By understanding the share of expenditures by category, for example, Canadians can get a sense of where their money is going and potentially identify areas where they can cut back on spending or find more cost-effective solutions.

For example, if a household spends a large proportion of its income on housing, it may want to consider downsizing or finding more affordable housing options. Similarly, if a household spends a significant amount on transportation, they may want to consider alternatives to driving, such as public transportation or carpooling.

Furthermore, understanding the trends in household net saving can also be useful in helping Canadians make financial decisions. A higher net saving rate may indicate that a household is living within its means and is better able to weather financial emergencies. On the other hand, a lower net saving rate may indicate that a household is living beyond its means and may be at risk of financial instability.

Overall, by examining this data and comparing it to their own spending and income habits, Canadians can make more informed decisions about their finances and potentially identify areas where they can make changes to improve their financial health. As we will see below, the data shows that Canadian households spend a significant proportion of their income on housing, transportation, food, and recreation. These categories consistently make up the largest shares of household expenditures over the years. Furthermore, the data shows that household net saving rates have increased in recent years, which may suggest that Canadians are becoming more cautious with their spending and are saving more of their income.

However, the increased savings, whether from caution or government stimulus during the pandemic, should be tempered by our observations of Canadian debt. In addition to expenditures and savings, we also observed increasing household debt levels. This data indicates that household debt levels have been on the rise, particularly in the form of mortgage debt and credit card debt. This may indicate that some Canadians are taking on more debt to maintain their standard of living or to purchase homes in increasingly expensive markets.

Overall, we can see that there have been some notable recent changes in some categories from 2019 to 2022. Despite being historically quite stable. Housing, water, electricity, gas, and other fuels have increased as a percentage of income, while transport, food and non-alcoholic beverages, and recreation and culture have all decreased. Insurance and financial services, miscellaneous goods and services, and health have all increased slightly, while food, beverage and accommodation services, clothing and footwear, and furnishings and household equipment have all decreased. Additionally, household net saving has increased significantly from 2.0% in 2019 to 5.9% in 2022.

Our initial analysis suggests that Canadians are facing challenges in balancing their spending and saving habits, particularly in the face of rising housing and living costs. It highlights the importance of making informed decisions about spending, debt, and savings.

We saw that there has been a consistent increase in the percentage of income that Canadians spend on housing-related expenses. Though the percentage of income spent on Housing, Water, Electricity, Gas and Other Fuels has remained similar from 2012 to 2022, Furnishings, Household Equipment, and Routine Household Maintenance has increased. This suggests that Canadians are spending more on maintaining and improving their homes, potentially driven by rising housing costs and a desire for more comfortable living spaces.

Another significant trend we observed is the decrease in the percentage of income that Canadians spend on transportation. Transport expenditures, including the purchase of vehicles and related expenses such as fuel and maintenance, have declined from 2012 to 2022. This could be due to a number of factors, including the rise of remote work and the increased availability of public transportation in some areas.

Food and non-alcoholic beverages also make up a significant portion of Canadian household expenditures, accounting for 13.5% of income in 2012 and 12.5% in 2022. While this percentage has decreased slightly over the past decade, it remains a major expense for Canadian households. Interestingly, despite the increase in housing and household-related expenditures, the percentage of income that Canadians save has also risen from 2.6% in 2012 to 6.8% in 2022. This suggests that Canadians are managing to balance their spending with an increased focus on savings and financial planning. Recent trends from our analysis of quarterly expenses, however, suggests that costs are steadily increasing in tandem with a decrease in overall savings, especially from Q2 2020 to Q2 2022.

However, it is important to note that overall Canadian debt levels, particularly mortgage and credit card debt, have also increased during this time period. This highlights the need for Canadians to carefully manage their spending and debt levels, particularly in the areas of housing and credit card usage. Lastly, the data on Canadian household expenditures from 2012 to 2022 reveals several important trends in Canadian spending habits. While there has been an increase in the percentage of income spent on housing-related expenses, Canadians have also managed to increase their savings rate. However, the rise in overall debt levels, particularly in mortgage and credit card debt, suggests the need for Canadians to carefully manage their finances and debt levels.
